# esa17-layouts

Work In Progress

This is a NodeCG bundle that works alongside the [nodecg-speedcontrol](https://github.com/speedcontrol/nodecg-speedcontrol) bundle. Developed/tested to work with NodeCG v0.8.9.

The music player component also requires OBS Studio Browser Source v1.30 or higher to pause/unpause music while not on the scenes with it in; as of time of writing, that version is not included in the OBS Studio download; update it from [the releases page on the obs-browser repo](https://github.com/kc5nra/obs-browser/releases).

- `npm install nodecg-cli` and install NodeCG
- `nodecg install speedcontrol/nodecg-speedcontrol` to install the master version of nodecg-speedcontrol.
- `nodecg install esamarathon/esa17-layouts` to install this layout bundle.
